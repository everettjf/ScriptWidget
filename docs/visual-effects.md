# Visual effects and fallbacks

**Material Study**, in built-in templates and Gallery, demonstrates an original frosted card and a fixed 3D tilt. It needs Runtime API 1.4, no permissions and no network. In Layout select the card's VStack, choose `backgroundMaterial`, then Apply a thickness or `none`. Undo/Redo and Package export use the existing source-preserving pipeline.

```jsx
$render(
  <zstack frame="max" background="#E7F6EE">
    <circle frame="80" color="#41B982"/>
    <vstack padding="18" corner="20" backgroundMaterial="thin"
      background="#FAFFFC" rotation3d="5,0,1,0">
      <text font="headline">A little calm</text>
    </vstack>
  </zstack>
);
```

## Capability assessment

| Effect | Native support | Web support and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frosted material | Public SwiftUI Material; ultraThin/thin/regular/thick/ultraThick | Explicit CSS backdrop-blur approximation; opaque fallback if CSS blur is unavailable |
| Reduce Transparency | Opaque base plus authored `background` color/gradient | Preview checkbox applies the same fallback policy without editing source |
| Reduce Motion | Removes static 3D tilt and suppresses legacy animation modifiers | Preview checkbox removes 3D transforms and freezes CSS/GIF preview frames |
| Clear/Tinted Liquid Glass | WidgetKit owns the system container appearance; local material is omitted in accented/vibrant mode | Neutral wallpaper stand-in and mode diagnostics; not a replica of the system material |
| Static depth | Public `rotation3DEffect` projection using `degree,x,y,z` | CSS perspective approximation; no device-motion reading or parallax |
| Content-update animation | System-controlled widget/Live Activity updates | A continuously running browser effect is not evidence of native continuous playback |
| Wallpaper matching/export | Existing native calibrated crop and PNG export | Guided image selection, pointer/numeric crops, slot replacement, portable configuration and PNG/package export; manual calibration is still required |
| Live/spatial system wallpaper | No control exposed to scripts/widgets by this implementation | No fake claim of changing the operating-system wallpaper |

Apple documents Material as blending content **inside** an app/widget, rather than the Home Screen behind it. The framework type is available from iOS 15/macOS 12, within this project's deployment targets. [SwiftUI Material](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/material).

Clear/Tinted appearance is a separate system treatment, driven by accented rendering and removable container backgrounds. Existing `widgetAccentable` and image `accentedRenderingMode` remain the relevant authoring controls. [WidgetKit Liquid Glass guidance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WidgetKit/optimizing-your-widget-for-accented-rendering-mode-and-liquid-glass).

Apple limits widget/Live Activity data-update animations to two seconds and may suppress them in Always On. That is not a guarantee of permanent clock, GIF or background animation. [Animating data updates](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/animating-data-updates-in-widgets-and-live-activities).

## Material policy and budgets

`backgroundMaterial="none"` preserves normal background behavior. Unsupported material names are ignored. Enabled material uses the authored `background` as a fallback, not as an opaque layer beneath the blur. Reduce Transparency composites that fallback over white/black, so alpha in a supplied color cannot defeat the opaque fallback. Accented/vibrant rendering omits local material for system legibility. Root material goes through the existing removable WidgetKit container background; app preview and nested cards use the same policy.

At most **four** enabled material backgrounds are permitted per resolved tree. Native and Web execution reject a fifth before drawing. Spacer ignores material as it ignores other background properties. Browser rendering also falls back after its own material budget. This bounds graph complexity; it does not certify a particular WidgetKit memory footprint. No timers, background sensors, custom shaders or separate render loops are added.

The native host uses the real read-only accessibility environment. A custom, internal EnvironmentKey can supply trusted preview/test overrides without setting Apple's private accessibility values; scripts cannot modify it. Web controls start from browser accessibility media preferences and allow local simulation. These flags are preview state, not widget permissions or exported mock data.

## Static 3D

`rotation3d="5,0,1,0"` means five degrees around the y-axis. Parsing requires four finite numbers and a nonzero axis. Large axes are normalized without overflow; the degree is reduced modulo 360. Malformed/nonfinite/zero-axis values render an unrotated fallback. Reduce Motion removes the tilt. This projects a flat view and does not generate a spatial scene or infer device movement. [SwiftUI rotation3DEffect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/rotation3DEffect(_:axis:anchor:anchorZ:perspective:)).

## Public animation compatibility

The old private clock-hand lookup/decoder and GIF arc masks have been removed. Clock, swing and GIF previews use public SwiftUI scheduling with explicit snapshot, inactive-scene and accessibility fallbacks. Mac retains static behavior, with standard clock hands now showing the selected time. See [timing, compatibility and verification](public-animations.md), including signed custom half-turn intervals and browser 0.18.0 changes. Actual WidgetKit scheduling and extension-memory acceptance remain separate; removing the private path alone does not establish App Store readiness.

## Bounded GIF assets

Native GIF loading uses system ImageIO instead of the former third-party GIF decoding call. It accepts regular local package files, rejects final-component symlinks and non-files without blocking, and reads at most 8 MiB before source creation. GIF type and canvas/frame dimensions are checked before thumbnail decoding: at most 1,048,576 source pixels, 60 animation frames and 4 MiB of retained decoded frame bytes per sequence. Thumbnail edges are at most 512 pixels and shrink further to fit the sequence budget; actual row-stride costs are checked. A GIF with more than 60 frames uses one bounded first frame. Invalid, oversized-byte or oversized-canvas files show `GIF unavailable`. These are asset budgets, not a claim that total WidgetKit process memory is 4 MiB.

The cache targets 4 MiB of decoded images and keys contents plus static/animated mode, so changing bytes at the same path cannot return the prior image. Variable frame delays retain their relative durations without expanding duplicate UIImage frames; delays below 11 ms normalize to 100 ms. Mac, Reduce Motion and reduced luminance render only the first frame. Active iOS previews use public scheduled frame selection; inactive/fixed-date renders decode only the first frame. No arc/mask/private clock path remains.

Web preflights used GIF blocks before pixel decoding, enforces the same input/canvas/frame limits, closes decoded frames/decoders and handles assets sequentially. Studio data URLs are decoded locally under its existing `connect-src 'self'` policy; no CSP permission is widened. Streamed resources also have actual-byte and timeout bounds. Live browser GIF playback is an approximation; when estimated RGBA frames exceed 4 MiB, it freezes a bounded first frame instead of trying to control the browser's animation cache. A warning identifies that fallback. Reduce Motion, Mac and ordinary image tags also use the first frame. Frozen previews are PNGs; a decoder failure shows a placeholder and never silently resumes animation. Without ImageDecoder, createImageBitmap supplies a first-frame approximation; ordinary snapshot mode now uses the same first frame as native, without the old weighted rest-frame approximation.

Native unit fixtures and the browser smoke use original solid-color GIFs generated by the test suite. They verify real first-frame pixels, timing, downsampling, stale-content rejection, malformed/oversized inputs, frame-limit fallback and failure behavior under Studio's CSP. Physical WidgetKit/Always On and extension-memory acceptance remain separate requirements. ImageIO thumbnail behavior follows Apple's [CGImageSource documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagesource).

The original red/blue fixture freezes on its red first frame:

## Wallpaper workflow

Use [Wallpaper Match](wallpaper-match.md) for explicit image selection, calibrated crops and PNG export. It does not set the OS wallpaper. macOS has a public app-level desktop-image setter, so it would be inaccurate to claim all platforms lack such an API; ScriptWidget does not expose it to imported widgets or invoke it here. [NSWorkspace desktop image API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/setdesktopimageurl(_:for:options:)).

The separate Web crop/export interface, actual Clear/Tinted/Home Screen behavior, signed WidgetKit delivery and extension/device memory still require work. M5-3 and M5-4 remain open. Native/Web tree equality proves resolved source semantics, not identical GPU blur, system refraction or real-device performance.

## Hosted performance evidence

The final local gate records five 329×155 frames with four material regions per frame, after plain/material/solid warmup. These are **hosted JSC + ImageRenderer app/test process samples**, not a WidgetKit extension budget or device acceptance:

| Host | Material: five frames / sampled footprint delta | Solid fallback: five frames / sampled delta |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mac | 12.93 ms / 0.30 MiB | 11.75 ms / 0.16 MiB |
| iPhone 17 Simulator | 27.49 ms / 0.72 MiB | 21.98 ms / 0.41 MiB |

The plain-to-all-warmup footprint change was 35.27 MiB on Mac and 0.63 MiB in this simulator run. First-use framework/shader/cache costs therefore must not be hidden behind the small warm-frame deltas. The samples are not a controlled causal comparison or a continuous peak-memory trace. Exact cold/warm values and test attachments are retained in `__Release/capabilities/effects/`; physical extension memory remains unproven.
